These are my projects. Follow the links in the README file to see my work
1) https://github.com/lcmcs/09-email-scraping-web-spider-DBKorn/tree/master/src
This project is an web scraper that scrapes the web looking for email addresses starting from touro.edu (my college). The program finds all the links on a webpage and stores them in a Queue, and puts the email addresses in a Set to avoid duplicates. When finished with a given webpage, the program goes the the link in the Queue and so on, till we've collected 10,000 email addresses. At the end, the email addresses are then sent to a database.
